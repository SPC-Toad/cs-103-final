      <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>Swift officially joined the music industry in 2004 at the age of just 14. She signed a music publishing
            deal with Sony/ATV. She was the company's youngest signing ever. Throughout her music career however, Swift has
            gone through many different "eras" - as she refers to them as. I would like to highlight two main eras of
            hers that I find to the most critical in her career.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Initial Breakthrough (2006-2008)</li>
              <li>Swift's self-titled debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), was released when she was just 16. Her
                early music was country themed, and involved stories about her young heartbreaks. Soon after, in
                2008, Swift released some of her most popular songs to this day, such as "Love Story,"
                "You Belong with Me," and "Fifteen,", all part of her second album, <em>Fearless</em>. This marked the true
                launch of Swift's career, as she won multiple Grammy Awards with this Album.</li>
          <li>Folk Influence (2020-2021)</li>
              <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift shocked everyone when she released a new album, <em>Folklore</em>.
                In stark contrast to her previous country and pop music, Swift adopted a completely new style of
                music. The reason I highlight this era in her life is because it was such a surprise to all her fans.
                After not producing music for several years (2017-2019) and barely posting on social media, the
                release of <em>Folklore</em> marked the resurgence of her career, which has not slowed down to
                this day.</li>
