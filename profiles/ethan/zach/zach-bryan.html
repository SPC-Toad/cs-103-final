    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>Born on April 2nd 1996, in Okinawa, Japan becasue his father was stationed there as part of a deployment with the U.S. Navy.</p>
    <p>Soon after his parents got divorced and lived mostly with his father where they moved Oologah, Oklahoma, near Tulsa.</p>
    <p> Music wasn't Bryan's sole focus at Oologah High School, where he was on the wrestling team and served as student council 
      president, but he was drawn to the idea of telling stories through song</p>
    <p>Bryan was also determined to continue a family legacy by joining the U.S. Navy. He enlisted in the Navy when he was just 17 years old.</p>
    <h3>Navy Service</h3>
    <p> Bryan served as an aviation ordnanceman in the Navy. He was responsible for assembling, repairing, and loading weapons. Bryan was stationed in Washington and 
      Florida and did tours of duty abroad in Bahrain and Djibouti</p>
    <h3>Music Career</h3>
    <p>During his free time, Bryan recorded songs. He began posting clips of his music online in 2015 and, in 2019, 
      recorded his first album DeAnn—his mother's middle name—with the help of his Navy friends at an Airbnb in Florida. A year later in 2020, he released his largest hit Heading South.</p>
    <p>His breakthrough came with the self-released album DeAnn (2019), a tribute to his late mother, which garnered attention for its heartfelt lyrics and stripped-down sound. He followed this with Elisabeth
       (2020), which continued his personal storytelling and refined his style.</p>
    <p>In 2022, Bryan released American Heartbreak, a 34-track album that solidified his place in the country and Americana scenes, debuting at number five on the Billboard 200. His success continued with his 
      2023 self-titled album Zach Bryan, which further expanded his fanbase.</p> 
    <p>Bryan's career represents a shift toward more authentic, emotionally raw music in country and Americana, contrasting with mainstream commercial trends. His ability to capture universal emotions through honest lyrics has made him a key figure 
      in modern country music, inspiring a new generation of fans and artists alike.</p>
