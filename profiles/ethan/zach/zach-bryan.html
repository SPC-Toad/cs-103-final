        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Born on April 2nd 1996, in Okinawa, Japan becasue his father was stationed there as part of a deployment with
            the U.S. Navy.</p>
        <p>Soon after his parents got divorced and lived mostly with his father where they moved Oologah, Oklahoma, near
            Tulsa.</p>
        <p> Music wasn't Bryan's sole focus at Oologah High School, where he was on the wrestling team and served as
            student council
            president, but he was drawn to the idea of telling stories through song</p>
        <p>Bryan was also determined to continue a family legacy by joining the U.S. Navy. He enlisted in the Navy when
            he was just 17 years old.</p>
        <h3>Navy Service</h3>
        <p> Zach Bryan enlisted in the Navy when he was just 17 years old, shortly after high school. He has stated that
            joining the military was partly due to a desire
            to escape the small-town life he grew up in, but also out of a sense of duty and patriotism.</p>
        <p>Being a young man from rural Oklahoma, the Navy provided him with an
            opportunity to travel and experience the world beyond his hometown. Bryan's decision was influenced by a
            combination of personal and external factors, including a desire
            to do something meaningful and the influence of family members who had served in the military.</p>
        <p>Bryan served as an aviation ordnanceman in the Navy. He was responsible for assembling,
            repairing, and loading weapons. Bryan was stationed in Washington and Florida and did tours of duty abroad
            in Bahrain and Djibouti.</p>
