        <h3>Music Career</h3>
        <p>During his free time, Bryan recorded songs. He began posting clips of his music online in 2015 and, in 2019,
            recorded his first album DeAnn—his mother's middle name—with the help of his Navy friends at an Airbnb in
            Florida. A year later in 2020, he released his largest hit Heading South.</p>
        <p>His breakthrough came with the self-released album DeAnn (2019), a tribute to his late mother, which garnered
            attention for its heartfelt lyrics and stripped-down sound. He followed this with Elisabeth
            (2020), which continued his personal storytelling and refined his style.</p>
        <p>Bryan's career represents a shift toward more authentic, emotionally raw music in country and Americana,
            contrasting with mainstream commercial trends. His ability to capture universal emotions through honest
            lyrics has made him a key figure
            in modern country music, inspiring a new generation of fans and artists alike.</p>
        <h3>2021: The Release of American Heartbreak</h3>
        <p>In 2021, Zach Bryan released American Heartbreak, a major career milestone. The album was a breakthrough in
            terms of
            both popularity and critical acclaim. Featuring a mix of country, folk, rock, and blues influences, it
            captured a broad range
            of Bryan's songwriting skills. American Heartbreak was one of the longest albums in recent memory, with 34
            tracks, further cementing his reputation as a prolific artist.</p>
        <p>The album's success catapulted him into a larger spotlight, earning him comparisons to mainstream country
            stars like Tyler Childers and Sturgill Simpson,
            yet he remained committed to his independent approach, continuing to release music without a major label
            backing.</p>
        <h3>2022: The Release of Summertime Blues</h3>
        <p>In 2022, Bryan released Summertime Blues, a collection of songs recorded live or in home studios, capturing
            the intimacy and authenticity
            of his earlier work. This project showcased his growth as a musician while staying true to his roots in
            country and folk traditions.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Bryan released American Heartbreak, a 34-track album that solidified his place in the country and
            Americana scenes, debuting at number five on the Billboard 200. His success continued with his
            2023 self-titled album Zach Bryan, which further expanded his fanbase.</p>
