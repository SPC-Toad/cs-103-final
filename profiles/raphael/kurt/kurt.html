    <p>Kurt Cobain was an iconic musician best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the band Nirvana, which played a key role in the grunge movement of the 1990s. Born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain grew up in a working-class family in a small, rainy town near Seattle. His early years were marked by a strong passion for music and art, but also by instability and hardship, especially following his parentsâ€™ divorce when he was nine years old. This split deeply affected him and influenced much of his later music, which often expressed themes of loneliness, alienation, and anger.</p>
