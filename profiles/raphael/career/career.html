    <p>Cobain's youth was challenging. He struggled with feelings of isolation, depression, and physical ailments, and found solace in punk rock music and drawing. He became fascinated with bands like the Sex Pistols and the Melvins, finding in their music a way to express his frustrations and inner turmoil. By his late teens, he was involved in the local punk scene, where he met Krist Novoselic, with whom he would later form Nirvana.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Nirvana's breakthrough album, Nevermind, in 1991 catapulted him into global fame, but he often struggled with the pressures of celebrity, feeling misunderstood by both fans and the media. Cobainâ€™s intense, often introspective lyrics and raw musical style resonated with a generation, though he also battled addiction and chronic health issues. Sadly, his life came to a tragic end on April 5, 1994, but his music and legacy have continued to influence artists and fans worldwide.</p>
