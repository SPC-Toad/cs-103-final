                Kanye West was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, always with a vision to reshape culture. 
                He started as a producer, gaining fame with beats for Jay-Z's The Blueprint. 
                But Kanye wanted more. In 2004, he dropped The College Dropout, blending personal stories with fresh sounds, setting himself apart.

                His next albums—Late Registration, Graduation, and 808s & Heartbreak—each broke ground, reflecting his evolving style and life struggles. 
                My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010 became a masterpiece, full of drama and perfection. 
                Then, with Yeezus, Kanye pushed hip-hop's boundaries, embracing raw, industrial sounds.
            
                Meanwhile, he launched Yeezy, revolutionizing sneaker culture and blending fashion with art. 
                The Life of Pablo (2016) introduced a “living album” concept, and in 2021, Donda, named after his mother, added a spiritual depth to his work.
            
                Kanye's impact spans music, fashion, and culture, always pushing boundaries and rethinking what's possible.
